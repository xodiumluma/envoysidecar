# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: listener
  change: |
    Previously a listener update with different :ref:`transparent <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.transparent>`, :ref:`freebind <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.freebind>`,
    :ref:`tcp_fast_open_queue_length <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.tcp_fast_open_queue_length>` or :ref:`socket_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.socket_options>` was ignored.
    Now, when those fields are updated, a new socket will be created for
    the listener and the new value of those fields applied to it. This only happens when :ref:`enable_reuse_port <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.enable_reuse_port>` is true.
    Otherwise if those fields change the update is rejected.
    New runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_update_listener_socket_options`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: build
  change: |
    removed the cares and apple resolvers as required extensions. Envoy now only creates DNS resolvers when necessary (e.g. for logical DNS cluster) so does not require cares to always be included. If your Envoys do DNS resolution and you override extensions_build_config you will need to include cares explicitly.

    moved the strict_dns, original_dst, and logical_dns clusters to extensions. If you use these clusters and override extensions_build_config.bzl you will now need to include it explicitly.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: cache_filter
  change: |
    add a completion callback to updateHeaders interface. Any external cache implementations will need to update to match this new interface. See changes to simple_http_cache in PR#23666 for example.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    Requests which match the passthrough header now have their own metric ``oauth_passthrough`` and aren't included in ``oauth_success`` anymore.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
    fix a bug when using http2, request body has google.api.HttpBody and the size is < 16KB, it will cause EOF from the backend grpc server.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed a bug that incorrectly rewrote the path when using ``regex_rewrite`` for redirects matched on prefix.
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    fixed a bug when passthrough header was matched, envoy would always remove the authorization header. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_header_passthrough_fix`` to false.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    fixed a bug that encoder filters and decoder filters of generic proxy will be executed in the same order. The encoder filters' execuate order should be the reverse of decoder filters' in the generic proxy.
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug where Utility::PercentEncoding::encode() encodes some characters incorrectly because it was treating the value as negative.

new_features:
- area: build
  change: |
    added an option ``--define=library_autolink=disabled`` to disable autolinking libraries.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`dubbo codec support <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.codecs.dubbo.v3.DubboCodecConfig>` to the
    :ref:`generic_proxy filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy>`.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added a new field :ref:`socket_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ExtraSourceAddress.socket_options>` to the ExtraSourceAddress, allowing specifying discrete socket options for each source address.
- area: thrift
  change: |
    added payload to metadata filter which matches a given payload field's value would be extracted and attached to the request as dynamic metadata.
- area: http
  change: |
    allowing the dynamic forward proxy cluster to :ref:`allow_coalesced_connections <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.clusters.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.ClusterConfig.allow_coalesced_connections>`  for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`generic rds support <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy.generic_rds>`.
- area: listener
  change: |
    added ``continueFilterChain()`` and ``dispatcher()`` methods to the ``ListenerFilterCallback``. This allows listener filters to continue listener filter iteration after stopping iteration e.g. if the listener filter depends on an async process.
- area: thrift_proxy
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.thrift_allow_negative_field_ids`` to support negative field ids for legacy thrift service.

  change: |

- area: mobile
  change: |
    started merging the Envoy mobile library into the main Envoy repo.
- area: redis
  change: |
    extended :ref:`cluster support <arch_overview_redis_cluster_support>` by adding a :ref:`dns_cache_config <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.redis_proxy.v3.RedisProxy.ConnPoolSettings.dns_cache_config>` option that can be used to resolve hostnames returned by MOVED/ASK responses.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    added support for setting the hostname used when sending spans to a Datadog collector using the :ref:`collector_hostname <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.DatadogConfig.collector_hostname>` field.
